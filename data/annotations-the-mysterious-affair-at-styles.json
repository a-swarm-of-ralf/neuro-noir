Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You\nwill notice that the word \u2018possessed\u2019 is spelt first with one \u2018s\u2019 and\nsubsequently with two\u2014correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\nin a sentence, thus: \u2018I am possessed.\u2019 Now, what did that tell me? It\ntold me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word \u2018possessed\u2019 that\nafternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\nin my mind, the possibility of a will\u2014(a document almost certain to\ncontain that word)\u2014occurred to me at once. This possibility was\nconfirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\nboudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\ntraces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\nfor some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\ndeposit."

She\nis seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\nand quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\nCynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\nMonsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too\nmany eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is\nmentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\ndoing."

        "fragment": "\u201c_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\nthink that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\nher once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\ndispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\none of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\nstudying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\naddition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\nthe precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\nsuddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\noccasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\ndissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp\u2019s large sized\nbottle of medicine when it came from Coot\u2019s? The risk is practically\nnil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\nanyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\nforgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\nquarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\nabsence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\nhad left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\nbrought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\nclever\u2014and that was their undoing.\u201d"
