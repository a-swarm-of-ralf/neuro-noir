In the note, the writer (Holmes) says there are \u201cone or two points of contact which I should wish to establish with Mr. Josiah Amberley\u201d and that once he has done so, \u201cwe can dismiss the case\u2014or not.\u201d He also asks Watson \u201cto be on hand about three o\u2019clock\u201d because he may want him. These are statements, but they neither describe a crime/event in detail nor provide motives, means, opportunity, alibis, or evidence; they are mainly plans and intentions. The available relations (said, testified, etc.) generally require an explicit person reference in the text itself. In this paragraph, \u201cI\u201d is not explicitly named as Holmes, and no direct speech tag like \u201csaid Holmes\u201d appears in this specific paragraph, so creating a Person \u2192 said \u2192 Statement triple would rely on extra inference from prior narrative context. To remain conservative and strictly grounded in the paragraph/history as required, it is safer not to assert any triples than to over-interpret the pronoun \u201cI\u201d into a named Person entity for a speech act.\n\nTherefore, no triple can be created that both (a) uses a permitted relation and (b) is fully grounded without additional assumptions beyond the text.",

There was a telephone,\nhowever, at the little 'Railway Arms,' and by it I got into touch with\nHolmes, who shared in our amazement at the result of our journey.",

I have\nunwittingly condemned you to the horrors of a country inn.  However,\nthere is always Nature, Watson--Nature and Josiah Amberley--you can be\nin close commune with both.\"  I heard his dry chuckle as he turned away.",
            "It was soon apparent to me that my companion's reputation as a miser\nwas not undeserved.  He had grumbled at the expense of the journey, had\ninsisted upon travelling third-class, and was now clamorous in his\nobjections to the hotel bill.  Next morning, when we did at last arrive\nin London, it was hard to say which of us was in the worse humour.",

            "\"If they are not worth more than the last ones they are not of much\nuse,\" said Amberley, with a malevolent scowl.  None the less, he kept\nme company.  I had already warned Holmes by telegram of the hour of our\narrival, but we found a message waiting that he was at Lewisham, and\nwould expect us there.  That was a surprise, but an even greater one\nwas to find that he was not alone in the sitting-room of our client.  A\nstern-looking, impassive man sat beside him, a dark man with\ngrey-tinted glasses and a large Masonic pin projecting from his tie.",
            "\"This is my friend Mr. Barker,\" said Holmes.  \"He has been interesting\nhimself also in your business, Mr. Josiah Amberley, though we have been\nworking independently.  But we both have the same question to ask you!\"",

            "The man sprang to his feet with a hoarse scream.  He clawed into the\nair with his bony hands.  His mouth was open, and for the instant he\nlooked like some horrible bird of prey.  In a flash we got a glimpse of\nthe real Josiah Amberley, a misshapen demon with a soul as distorted as\nhis body.  As he fell back into his chair he clapped his hand to his\nlips as if to stifle a cough.  Holmes sprang at his throat like a\ntiger, and twisted his face towards the ground.  A white pellet fell\nfrom between his gasping lips.",

Why should this man at such a time be filling\nhis house with strong odours?  Obviously, to cover some other smell\nwhich he wished to conceal--some guilty smell which would suggest\nsuspicions.  Then came the idea of a room such as you see here with\niron door and shutter--a hermetically sealed room.  Put those two facts\ntogether, and whither do they lead?  I could only determine that by\nexamining the house myself.  I was already certain that the case was\nserious, for I had examined the box-office chart at the Haymarket\nTheatre--another of Dr. Watson's bull's-eyes--and ascertained that\nneither B thirty nor thirty-two of the upper circle had been occupied\nthat night.  Therefore, Amberley had not been to the theatre, and his\nalibi fell to the ground.  He made a bad slip when he allowed my astute\nfriend to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife.  The\nquestion now arose how I might be able to examine the house.  I sent an\nagent to the most impossible village I could think of, and summoned my\nman to it at such an hour that he could not possibly get back.  To\nprevent any miscarriage, Dr. Watson accompanied him.  The good vicar's\nname I took, of course, out of my Crockford.  Do I make it all clear to\nyou?\"",

You see the gas-pipe along the skirting here.\nVery good.  It rises in the angle of the wall, and there is a tap here\nin the corner.  The pipe runs out into the strong-room, as you can see,\nand ends in that plaster rose in the centre of the ceiling, where it is\nconcealed by the ornamentation.  That end is wide open.  At any moment\nby turning the outside tap the room could be flooded with gas.  With\ndoor and shutter closed and the tap full on I would not give two\nminutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up in that little\nchamber.  By what devilish device he decoyed them there I do not know,\nbut once inside the door they were at his mercy.\"",

Then came the idea of a room such as you see here with\niron door and shutter--a hermetically sealed room.  Put those two facts\ntogether, and whither do they lead?  I could only determine that by\nexamining the house myself.  I was already certain that the case was\nserious, for I had examined the box-office chart at the Haymarket\nTheatre--another of Dr. Watson's bull's-eyes--and ascertained that\nneither B thirty nor thirty-two of the upper circle had been occupied\nthat night.  Therefore, Amberley had not been to the theatre, and his\nalibi fell to the ground.  He made a bad slip when he allowed my astute\nfriend to notice the number of the seat taken for his wife.  The\nquestion now arose how I might be able to examine the house.  I sent an\nagent to the most impossible village I could think of, and summoned my\nman to it at such an hour that he could not possibly get back.  To\nprevent any miscarriage, Dr. Watson accompanied him.  The good vicar's\nname I took, of course, out of my Crockford.  Do I make it all clear to\nyou?\"",

You see the gas-pipe along the skirting here.\nVery good.  It rises in the angle of the wall, and there is a tap here\nin the corner.  The pipe runs out into the strong-room, as you can see,\nand ends in that plaster rose in the centre of the ceiling, where it is\nconcealed by the ornamentation.  That end is wide open.  At any moment\nby turning the outside tap the room could be flooded with gas.  With\ndoor and shutter closed and the tap full on I would not give two\nminutes of conscious sensation to anyone shut up in that little\nchamber.  By what devilish device he decoyed them there I do not know,\nbut once inside the door they were at his mercy.\"",
            "The Inspector examined the pipe with interest.  \"One of our officers\nmentioned the smell of gas,\" said he, \"but, of course, the window and\ndoor were open then, and the paint--or some of it--was already about.\nHe had begun the work of painting the day before, according to his\nstory.

            "\"Well, then came an incident which was rather unexpected to myself.  I\nwas slipping through the pantry window in the early dawn when I felt a\nhand inside my collar, and a voice said: 'Now, you rascal, what are you\ndoing in there?'  When I could twist my head round I looked into the\ntinted spectacles of my friend and rival, Mr. Barker.  It was a curious\nforgathering, and set us both smiling.  It seems that he had been\nengaged by Dr. Ray Ernest's family to make some investigations, and had\ncome to the same conclusion as to foul play.  He had watched the house\nfor some days, and had spotted Dr. Watson as one of the obviously\nsuspicious characters who had called there.  He could hardly arrest\nWatson, but when he saw a man actually climbing out of the pantry\nwindow there came a limit to his restraint.
