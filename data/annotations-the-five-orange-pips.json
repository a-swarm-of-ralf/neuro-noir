Some, however, have already gained\npublicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for\nthose peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,\nand which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too,\nhave baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,\nbeginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially\ncleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture\nand surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in\nits details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give\nsome account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\nentirely cleared up."

In the latter, as may be\nremembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\u2019s\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\u2014a deduction\nwhich was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case.
